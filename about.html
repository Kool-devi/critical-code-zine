                This glossary/index offers a series of terms and definitions developed by the Critical Code class of
                Fall 2025 (DIGF-4002). In groups, students self-selected terms informed by their own interests and
                intersections with course topics, themes, and class discussions.

            <p>
                Following a June 2025 MIT study on the effects of LLMs on “cognitive debt” in essay writing (Kosmyna et
                al. 2025), groups chose initial development modalities of “brain-only”, “search-engine assisted”, and
                “LLM-assisted” to develop their definitions. The definitions went through two rounds of iterative
                drafting and peer feedback and (as you might imagine) the lines between these modalities got a bit
                blurry and messy, further emphasizing our entangled relations to code, technology, and production.
                Definition development ended with a handwritten (-drawn, -diagrammed) “quiz”, intended to provoke a
                moment of reflection on how research and writing modalities may have impacted students’ learning and
                internalization of their chosen terms and definitions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each entry includes: a brief definition and a custom code component demonstrating the concept (or one
                aspect) computationally, supported by scholarly references and case studies from across
                interdisciplinary art, design, media, and technology spaces. For reflexive learning and transparency,
                each group definition also offers a meta-reflection on how Generative AI was engaged throughout the
                development process.
            </p>

            <p>
                The definitions here are not intended to be definitive or “complete” but rather offer context and
                glimpses into ongoing technological, discursive, and cultural currents, including contemporary debates
                around AI, ethics, computing, and code. They explore the complexities of knowledge production alongside
                the aesthetic and poetic potentials of language and computation.
            </p>
